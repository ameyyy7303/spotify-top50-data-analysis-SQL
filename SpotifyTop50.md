--- Explanation:
CTE key_popularity:

Calculates the average popularity for each musical key across the entire dataset.
AVG(popularity) gives the average popularity score for each key.
CTE key_representation:

Counts how many times each musical key appears in the dataset.
COUNT(*) provides the number of occurrences for each key.
Main Query:

Joins the two CTEs (key_popularity and key_representation) to combine the average popularity with the representation count for each musical key.
Orders the results by avg_popularity and representation_count in descending order to compare popularity and frequency.
This query gives you a comprehensive view of how each musical key ranks in terms of average popularity and how frequently it appears among the top 50 tracks.
